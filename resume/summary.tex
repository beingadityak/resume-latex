Current DevOps Engineer at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). 4+ years of experience working with emerging technologies tied to DevOps. I drive performance and reliability across multiple platforms, working closely with development and QA teams to understand requirements for build, test, deploy and release processes. I am good at doing most of the things which interest me \& work best in situations where I have a lot of flexibility and also able to use my creativity and skills.
